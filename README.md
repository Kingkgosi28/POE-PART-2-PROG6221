Part 2: Improvements from part 1 

Building upon the core functionality, this code introduces an enhancement:

Reset Recipe Functionality: A new method named "ResetRecipe" is added to the Recipe class. This method iterates through the list of ingredients and calls the "Reset" method on each one, effectively restoring them to their original quantities. Additionally, it calls the "DisplayQuantities" method to showcase the reset quantities for each ingredient.
This improvement allows users to easily revert a scaled recipe back to its original state, providing greater flexibility in recipe management.

Part 2: Explained 
This code utilizes object-oriented programming principles to create reusable components. The use of a delegate ("CaloriesExceededDelegate") allows for flexibility in handling notifications about exceeding calorie limits. The separation of concerns between classes and methods promotes code maintainability and readability.

The provided code demonstrates a well-designed structure for representing recipes and their ingredients in C#. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionalities:

Classes:

Ingredient: This class stores information about a single ingredient used in a recipe. It includes properties for name, quantity, unit of measurement, original quantity (useful for scaling), calories, and food group. Additionally, it offers methods to:
Scale the quantity based on a factor.
Reset the quantity back to its original value.
Display both the current and original quantities.
Step: This class represents a single step in a recipe and has a single property - "Description" - to hold the textual instructions for that step.
Recipe: This class serves as the core component for managing recipes. It has properties for:
Name of the recipe.
List of Ingredient objects associated with the recipe.
List of Step objects representing the steps involved in preparing the recipe.
A delegate instance of "CaloriesExceededDelegate" to handle notifications when calorie limits are exceeded.
Methods in Recipe Class:

DisplayRecipe: This method displays the recipe details on the console. It includes the recipe name, a list of ingredients with their details (including calories and food group), a list of numbered steps, and the total calories of the recipe. If the total calories exceed 300, it invokes the "CaloriesExceeded" delegate (if assigned) to display a warning message.
ScaleRecipe: This method scales all the ingredients in the recipe by a specified factor. It iterates through the "Ingredients" list and calls the "Scale" method on each ingredient object.
ResetRecipe: This method resets all ingredients in the recipe back to their original quantities. It iterates through the "Ingredients" list, calls the "Reset" method on each ingredient, and additionally calls the "DisplayQuantities" method to showcase the reset quantities.
